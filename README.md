# What Is This?

This is my full-stack portfolio site written entirely in Rust to prove the haters wrong -- Rust _is_ production ready. This is both a place to blog about computer science and a form of artistic expression.

![crt tv gif][crt tv gif]

I implemented a retro, CRT TV theme. The background GIF changes on each page refresh and a static GIF loads between each GIF change, simulating flipping through TV channels. All GIFs are miscellaneous screen captures from many different animes -- some are mellow, while others are packed with action. There are many more GIFs I would have liked to include in the rotation, but I have restricted the GIFs to anime to keep consistent with a single theme. This list of GIFs will continue to grow over the years as I find more GIFs that suit the aesthetics of the site. Enjoy cycling through the GIFs!

The site consists of many little easter eggs, including but not limited to:

- A dynamic GIF background that changes on each page refresh.
- 404 page stories about a digital nomad getting lost, generated by ChatGPT.

# Where Does the Violence Data Come From?

My site pulls data from the City of Chicago's Socrata API. Here are links to the documentation:

- [Violence Reduction - Shotspotter Alerts][violence reduction - shotspotter alerts]
- [Violence Reduction - Victims of Homicides and Non-Fatal Shootings][violence reduction - victims of homicides and non-fatal shootings]

The City of Chicago's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) codes and descriptions may be found [at this page][city of chicago ucr codes].
